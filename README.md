These scripts are used to train a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) on supersymmetry (pMSSM)
parameter points and their experimental predictions.

The BNN is trained using Radford Neal's Software for Flexible Bayesian Modeling and Markov Chain Sampling (fbm).

train_MPK.sh sets up, trains, and tests a BNN with 19 inputs , 3 hidden layers, and one output.
